([BuildContext](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/BuildContext-class.html) context, [String](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-core/String-class.html) id, [String](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-core/String-class.html) type, [GlobalKey](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/GlobalKey-class.html)&lt;[ScaffoldState](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/ScaffoldState-class.html)> scaffoldKey, [bool](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-core/bool-class.html) initialDataLoad, {[Function](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-core/Function-class.html)? notifierFunction})








## Implementation

```dart
Widget runBuild(BuildContext context, String id, String type,
    GlobalKey<ScaffoldState> scaffoldKey, bool initialDataLoad,
    {Function? notifierFunction});
